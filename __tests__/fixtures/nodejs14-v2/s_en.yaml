    # If you only want to perform related operations on the business below helloworld, you can add helloworld to the command line, for example:
    # Build only helloworld: s helloworld build
    # If s build is directly executed without helloworld, the tool will perform the same operation on all business modules at the same level as helloworld under the current Yaml (if there are other level modules, such as the next-function commented below), according to certain Sequential build operations
    component: fc    # The name of the component. The Serverless Devs tool itself is similar to a game console and does not have specific business capabilities. The component is similar to a game card. Users can achieve different functions by inserting different game cards into the game console, that is, by using Different components implement different specific business capabilities
