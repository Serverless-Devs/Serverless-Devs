### Parameters
Navigate through the command's options with ease, each tailored for a specific aspect of the clean-up process:

### Usage Examples
To purge a specific component, employ the `--component` flag alongside the name of the component:
```shell script
$ s clean --component fc api
[2023-******][INFO][s_cli] Component [fc api] has been cleaned up successfully.
```
For cache removal, utilize the `--cache` option as demonstrated below:
```shell script
$ s clean --cache 
[2023-******][INFO][s_cli] Cache cleaned up successfully.
```
Log file clean-up can be achieved through the `--logs` parameter:
```shell script
$ s clean --logs
[2023-******][INFO][s_cli] Logs cleaned up successfully.
```
For an all-encompassing clean-up, the `--all` parameter is at your disposal:
```shell script
$ s clean --all       
[2023-******][INFO][s_cli] Component cleaned up successfully.
[2023-******][INFO][s_cli] Cache cleaned up successfully.
[2023-******][INFO][s_cli] Logs cleaned up successfully.
[2023-******][INFO][s_cli] The environment of Serverless Devs has been cleaned up successfully.
```
## Cautions
Please note the following protocols when executing a component-specific clean-up:
1. The system will first assess if there are any corresponding components within the current Registry cache and proceed to clear them.
2. Following that, the system will purge the ultimate Registry cache, the Github Registry, eradicating any components that match the criteria.
