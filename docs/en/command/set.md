## set registry command

The set registry command is used to configure repositories for Serverless Devs. 

After you run the `s set registry -h` command, the following help information is returned:


```shell script
$ s set registry -h

```

You can use the following methods to run the set registry command: 
1. Provide Registry information directly, for example:`s set registry http://registry.devsapp.cn/simple`
2. Run the command in interactive mode. Example: 
    ```shell script
    $ s set registry
    
    🔎 Current registry: http://registry.devsapp.cn/simple
    
    ? Choose a registry? (Use arrow keys)
    ❯ serverless registry [http://registry.devsapp.cn/simple] 
      github registry [https://api.github.com/repos]
      gitee registry [http://gitee.registry.devsapp.cn/simple]
      custom registry 
    ```
    Then, follow instructions to select options based on your business requirements.

> You can use the following repositories: Github Registry, Gitee Registry, and Serverless Devs Registry. The following information describes the relationships among the three repositories: 
> - Github Registry: the ultimate default repository. Even if you do not configure Github Registry for your project, this repository is used when the required information cannot be found in the repository that you configure. 
> - Gitee Registry: the repository that Gitee and Alibaba Cloud jointly develop for Chinese users. 
> - Serverless Devs Registry: the default repository for the Serverless Devs community and the default repository for your project.    
> The following flowchart shows how data is loaded in Serverless Devs.
