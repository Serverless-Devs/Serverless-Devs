# Quick Start

This quick start case takes [Alibaba Cloud Function Computing](https://github.com/devsapp/fc) as an example to quickly start with Serverless Devs(Of course, Serverless Devs also supports [AWS Lambda](https://github.com/devscomp/lambda), [Baidu Cloud Function Computing](https://github.com/xinwuyun/cfc), [Huawei Cloud Function Workflow](https://github.com/zy-linn/fgs-component) , [Tencent Cloud Function](https://github.com/devscomp/scf) and many other cloud vendors’ FaaS platforms. For details):
- [Tool installation](#Tool-installation)
- [Key Configuration](#Key-Configuration)
- [Get started experience](#Get-started-experience)
    - [Serverless: Hello World](#ServerlessHello-World)
    - [AI: Target Detection](#AITarget-Detection)
    - [Traditional framework: Django-based blog project](#Traditional-framework-based-on-django-blog-project)

## Tool installation
- Step 1: Install Node.js (>=12.0.0) and NPM package management tool;
- Step 2: Install Serverless Devs developer tools;
    ```shell script
    $ npm install @serverless-devs/s -g
    ```
- Step 3: You can use `s -v` to judge whether the tool is installed successfully. If the installation is successful, you can see the corresponding version information, for example:
    ```shell script
    @serverless-devs/s: 2.1.2, core: 0.1.41, s-home: /Users/xxx/.s, darwin-x64, node-v17.7.1
    ```

## Key Configuration

> Since this quick start document will take [Alibaba Cloud Function Computing](https://www.aliyun.com/product/fc) as an example, the password configuration here is also based on Alibaba Cloud password configuration:
> - Get key: https://usercenter.console.aliyun.com/#/manage/ak

- Open [Get Key Page](https://usercenter.console.aliyun.com/#/manage/ak) to obtain key:
  ![Get Key Page](https://images.devsapp.cn/access/aliyun-access.jpg)
 
- Execute `s config add` and select `Alibaba Cloud (alibaba)`:
    ```shell script
    $ s config add 
    ? Please select a provider: Alibaba Cloud (alibaba)
    🧭 Refer to the document for alibaba key:  http://config.devsapp.net/account/alibaba
    ? AccessKeyID: 
    ```
- At this point, you can follow the instructions to configure the key:
    ```shell script
    ? Please select a template: Alibaba Cloud (alibaba)
    🧭 Refer to the document for alibaba key:  http://config.devsapp.net/account/alibaba
    ? AccessKeyID Fill in AccessKeyID here
    ? AccessKeySecret Fill in AccessKeySecret here
    ? Please create alias for key pair. If not, please enter to skip alibaba-access
    
        Alias: alibaba-access
        AccountID: Get AccountID automatically
        AccessKeyID: Fill in AccessKeyID here
        AccessKeySecret: Fill in AccessKeySecret here
    
    ✔ Configuration successful
    ```
- In order to verify whether the password is correctly configured, you can view the specified password through `s config get -a alibaba-access`:
    ```shell script
    $ s config get -a alibaba-access
    alibaba-access:
      AccountID: *******ID
      AccessKeyID: *********ID
      AccessKeySecret: *************key
    ```
  
  
> AccessKey is the key for your cloud account to access the Alibaba Cloud API. It has full permissions for the account. Please keep it safe! Do not share AccessKey to external channels in any way (eg Github) to avoid being used by others to cause [security threat](https://help.aliyun.com/knowledge_detail/54059.html?spm=5176.2020520153.0.0.57f1336a8PQ1KR ).  
> Strongly recommended that you follow the [Alibaba Cloud Security Best Practices](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/102600.html?spm=5176.2020520153.0.0.57f1336a8PQ1KR) and use the RAM sub-user AccessKey to make API calls.


## Get started experience

### Serverless：Hello World

- Execute the `s` command:
    ```shell script
    $ s
    ? No Serverless-Devs project is currently detected. Do you want to create a new project? (Y/n)  
    ```  
- Fill in `y` and press Enter to enter the creation guide section:
    ```shell script
    🚀 More applications: https://registry.serverless-devs.com
    
    ? Hello Serverless for Cloud Vendors (Use arrow keys or type to search)
    ❯ Alibaba Cloud Serverless 
      AWS Cloud Serverless 
      Baidu Cloud Serverless 
      Huawei Cloud Serverless 
      Tencent Cloud Serverless 
      Dev Template for Serverless Devs 
    ```

- At the same time, you only need to select the corresponding option and follow the instructions. For example, if you select `Alibaba Cloud Serverless`, you can see the classification of application templates under Alibaba Cloud Serverless products:

    ```shell script
     ? Hello, serverlesser. Which template do you like? (Use arrow keys or type to search)
     ❯ Quick start [Deploy a Hello World function to FaaS]
       Container example [Deploy function to FaaS with custom-container]
       Web Framework [Deploy a web framework to FaaS]
       Static website [Deploy a static website]
       Best practice [Experience serverless project]
    ```

- At this time, you can continue to select specific applications under a certain category for initialization. For example, after selecting `fc-runtime-starter`, you can see the specific template applications under that category:

    ```shell script
    ? Which template do you like? (Use arrow keys or type to search)
    ❯ [HTTP] Node.js 14  - Quickly deploy a nodejs14 http function
      [HTTP] Python3     - Quickly deploy a  python3 http function 
      [HTTP] Java8       - Quickly deploy a  java8 http function 
      [HTTP] PHP7        - Quickly deploy a  php7 http function 
      [HTTP] C++ (custom)- Quickly deploy a  C++ http function 
      [Event] Node.js 14 - Quickly deploy a  nodejs14 event function
      [Event] Python3    - Quickly deploy a  python3 event function
      ... ...
    ```

   Select `[HTTP] Node.js 14` to complete the creation. During the boot process, the process of filling in the project name and selecting the key may appear:
    - The project name can be: `start-fc-http-nodejs14`
    - The region name can be: `cn-hangzhou`
    - The service name can be： `hello-world-service`
    - The function name can be： `start-fc-http-nodejs14`
    - The key can be the one we created above: `alibaba-access`

   E.g:
   ```shell script 
    🚀  More applications: https://registry.serverless-devs.com

    ? Hello Serverless for Cloud Vendors Alibaba Cloud Serverless
    ? Hello, serverlesser. Which template do you like? Quick start [Deploy a Hello World function to FaaS]
    ? Which template do you like? [HTTP] Node.js 14

    😋  Create application command: [s init devsapp/start-fc-http-nodejs14]

    ? Please input your project name (init dir) start-fc-http-nodejs14
